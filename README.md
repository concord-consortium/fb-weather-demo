# fb-weather-demo

A quick and dirty demo of using firebase for a classroom weather simulation.

## Working with this project:

1. Prerequisits: Install [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)
if they are not already installed  your development system.  Also install `live-server` using `npm install -g live-server`
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn` in this directory.
3. Start `webpack-dev-server`
4. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) note: `127.0.0.1` will not work at the moment, because it isn't a white-listed host on the firebase site.
5. Work.
